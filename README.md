## About Me 🚀

I like to think of myself as a *beginner with curiosity as my superpower* 🦸🏽‍♂.  
Right now, I’m rebuilding my coding journey from scratch — learning, experimenting, and having fun along the way.  

- 🌱 Currently learning: JavaScript (and yes, it sometimes fights me back 😅)  
- 🔭 Working on: small web projects & starter repos  
- 🌍 Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and human: English)  
- 📫 How to reach me: [https://wa.me/qr/DF3ZVTQPB5R2P1]  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I sometimes break my own code just to learn how to fix it 🛠  



## My Skills 🧠

Even though I’m just getting started, here are the tools I’ve picked up so far:

(React and Node.js are on my “next up” list 👀)  



## Featured Projects 💻  

Since I’m still building my portfolio, here are some starter projects I’m working on:  

### [Beginner Project 1](#)  
My first attempt at making something interactive with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

### [Beginner Project 2](#)  
A small project where I practice styling and layout. Nothing fancy yet, but progress is progress!
